title: Colorize Google calendar events with AppScript
tags: gcal AppScript

Some time ago, I started to use [Clockwise](https://www.getclockwise.com/), and one of the feature I loved was that my calendar events were colorised based on the type of meeting. After some time, because many team mates were using it, Clockwise started to ask me to subscribe, and I was not willing to do that. So I unistaled it and all my meetings were bleu again.

So I wondered how can I get my beatifull calendar back, and decided to have a look at Google AppScript APIs.
